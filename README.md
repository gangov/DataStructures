# Data-Structures
This repository includes the implementation of the follow structures of data:
1. HashTables
2. Heaps
3. Lists
4. Queues
5. Stacks
6. Trees

In addition to the data structures I've included an implementation of the following sorting and searching algorithms:
  1. Search algorithms:

  1.1. Binary search (iteratively and recursively)
  
  1.2. Linear search
  
  2. Sort algoritms:

  2.1. Buble sort
 
  2.2. Counting sort
  
	2.3. Insertion sort
  
	2.4. Merge Sort
  
	2.5. Quick sort
  
	2.6. Radix sort
  
	2.7. Recursion (not a search or sort algorithm, but had to include it for the next sort algorithms)
  
	2.8. Recursive insertion sort
  
	2.9. Reversed merge sort
  
	2.10. Selection sort
  
	2.11. Shell sort
